/**
 * Release Notes System
 *
 * This module manages the "What's new" feature that shows users what has changed
 * between plugin versions. The system works as follows:
 *
 * 1. On plugin load, it compares the current version with the last shown version
 * 2. If version increased, it shows all release notes between versions
 * 3. Same or downgraded versions never auto-display
 * 4. Individual releases can be marked with showOnUpdate: false to skip auto-display
 * 5. Users can always manually access release notes via plugin settings
 *
 * The lastShownVersion is stored in synced settings and device-local storage. The greater value is
 * used so synced devices normally share one display while stale settings cannot repeat it locally.
